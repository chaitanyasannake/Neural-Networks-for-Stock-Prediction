# Neural Networks for Stock Trading

## Introduction

This project explores the feasibility of using advanced neural network models to predict movements in the stock market, specifically focusing on the S&P500 index. Traditional methods like Time Series analysis and modern approaches such as Neural Networks (NN) including Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are employed to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Objectives

The primary goal is to integrate and assess various neural network architectures to determine their effectiveness in predicting stock price movements, thereby aiding financial decision-making processes. The project particularly aims to:
- Forecast single future points with high precision.
- Predict immediate market trends effectively.
- Improve multi-step market trend forecasting.
- Optimize predictions in volatile market conditions using multi-layered models.

## Data Collection

Historical data of the S&P500 index, available from Yahoo Finance, serves as the backbone for training our models. The dataset spans several decades, providing a robust foundation for training and testing our predictive models.
